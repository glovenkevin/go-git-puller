# Git Pull Command using Golang

This is my project built using golang for pulling git repository recursively. 
I got idea for doing this project for completting the gitlabber minor function that has not been doing 
and the project going down or no updates anymore. 

## Next Feature

- update folder gitlab structure
- clone all gitlab project as gitlabber do 

## TO-DO

Help for the next upcomming feature and add test module
